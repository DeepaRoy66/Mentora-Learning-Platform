Mentora Learning Platform

Project Overview

Mentora is a focused learning platform that enables learners to study from a specific mentor’s uploaded notes. The system generates AI-based summaries strictly from selected notes and converts them into customizable MCQ quizzes. A gamified Q&A community, Mini Stackflow, enhances peer learning and engagement.
Learning Challenges Addressed
Learners often face difficulty identifying reliable study material, experience information overload, and lack effective tools to convert notes into assessments. Mentora addresses these challenges by providing mentor-specific content, AI-driven summarization, and instant practice through MCQs, ensuring focused and efficient learning.

Week 1 outcomes

By the end of Week 1, Mentora has established a solid foundation with a clearly defined learning problem, aligned with learner requirements, and supported by a well-structured database and workflow, preparing the platform for quick prototyping in the upcoming weeks.

Week 2 Focus Areas

1) Map user journeys and interaction flows for Admin, Mentor, and Learner roles
2) Confirm feature priorities for the prototype (user authentication, notes upload, AI-based summarization, MCQ creation)
3) Start designing low-fidelity UI layouts (dashboards, note selection, summary display, MCQ interface, community forum)
